# Vidly - online movie rental

---

The [vidly project](https://thawing-wildwood-91061.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on `Heroku Cloud Platform` and is connected to real API.

Keep in mind it takes a little while to load API when you visit Vidly site.

_You may find that this project uses outdated technology which is Class components, well I thought getting to know React from its roots is probably the best way to understand today's workflow and reasoning behind Hooks. The knowledge I grasped while building this project helps me to write modern React code efficiently. Also, because many of the libraries were outdated, it forced me to solve a lot of compatibility issues which improved my skills even further._

## Foreword
